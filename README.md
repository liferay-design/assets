# Testing, testing, hello? Is this thing on?

_This is a starter kit + repo of svg animations created by [Designers @ Liferay](https://liferay.design/team) for Liferay.com, and other products._

A super quick way to throw assets up into the cloud if you want to render them in codepen or...wherever for testing purposes.

This is also a great way to share assets with each other!

## About

Currently, this is "just" a repo, eventually all assets will be made available in a library on liferay.design/blueprints

## Goals

Quickly develop consistent svg animations, and share improvements along the way.
